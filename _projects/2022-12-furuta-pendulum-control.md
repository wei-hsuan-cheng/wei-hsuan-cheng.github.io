# Project overview

This project aims to stabilise the Furuta pendulum system by the design of state-observer feedback controller. An internal model is proposed to reject the sinusoidal process noise in the input signal of maxon motor. The simulation of system dynamics and code implementation of control algorithm are done using ``Simulink``, ``Simscape``, and ``MATLAB``.
