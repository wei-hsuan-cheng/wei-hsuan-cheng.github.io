**Looking for PhD position in robotics!!**

Hi, this is Wei-Hsuan Cheng (he/him). I am currently a master student at [Robots and Medical Mechatronics Lab (RMML)][RMML], [Department of Biomechatronics Engineering][NTUBME], [National Taiwan University (NTU)][NTU]. 

My research interest lies on fields of ``robotics``, particularly in ``robotic arm manipulations``. I have experience in diverse domains in robotics, including and not limited to
- ``Teleoperation`` robotic system through ``wireless communication``
- Robotic ``dexterous`` manipulations
- Robotic arm ``vision-`` and ``force-``based controls
- ``Kalman filtering``
- Application of ``geometric algebra`` in robotics

Check out my [projects] and [resume] here. Reach out if you’re intereted in what I’m doing!
