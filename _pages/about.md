<!-- **Looking for PhD position in robotics!!** -->

Hi, this is Wei-Hsuan Cheng (he/him). I am currently a Master's student at [Robots and Medical Mechatronics Lab (RMML)][RMML], [Department of Biomechatronics Engineering][NTUBME], [National Taiwan University (NTU)][NTU], advised by *[Prof. Ping-Lang Yen]*. 

- Master's thesis title: *“Application of Vision- and Force-Based Supervisory Teleoperation for Robotic Dexterous Manipulation Tasks in Industrial Surveillance”*

My research interest lies on fields of ``robotics``, particularly in ``robotic arm manipulations``. I have experience in diverse domains in robotics, including and not limited to
- ``Teleoperation`` robotic system through ``wireless communication``
- Robotic ``dexterous`` manipulations (contact-rich, physical interactions, compliant motions, etc.)
- Robotic arm ``vision-`` and ``force-``based controls (visual servoing, admittance control, etc.)
- ``Kalman filtering`` (EKF, UKF, etc.)
- Application of ``geometric algebra`` in robotics

Check out my [projects] and [resume] here. Reach out if you’re intereted in what I’m doing!
