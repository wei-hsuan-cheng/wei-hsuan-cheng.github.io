# Project overview

The geometric inverse kinematics (IK) solver based on **conformal geometric algebra (CGA)**, a powerful mathematical framework for representing geometry. CGA provides numerous geometric insights into the robot that are nearly impossible to achieve using traditional matrix methods. The IK solver have been tested on 6-DoF collaborative robotic arms (TM5-700 and TM5-900).

The CGA-based inverse kinematics (IK) solver for 6-DoF collaborative robotic arm is implemented in both  ``ROS 2 C++``, ``Python`` and ``JavaScript`` and can be found in <a href='https://github.com/wei-hsuan-cheng/cga_ik' target='_blank' style='text-decoration: none;'><i class='fab fa-github' style=''></i><span style='margin-left: 0.13cm'>cga_ik</span></a>.

> I have also given a [special talk] on the CGA and its application in robotics in a GA study group @ NTU EE.

# Interactive visualisation for CGA IK

**Drag the mouse cursor to change IK target pose, robot configurations and see the results. You can also modify the codes to change parameters through the [interactive visualisation website]!**
